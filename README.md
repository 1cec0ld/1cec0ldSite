## About
This is my personal site, where I post my projects and other stuff.



## Projects
### Games
#### Momentum
Drag the large object around and attempt to hit the smaller ones. If they hit you in the back, you lose a life. Beware, hitting them imparts your momentum to them, so they move faster, making them harder to dodge!

#### Gravity
Change the gravity of the planets, then start the game. The goal is to get the left side ball to the target planet using only the gravity of the planets in front of it.
